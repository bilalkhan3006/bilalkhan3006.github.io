            <h3 class="text-warning">Causes of Chemical Waste</h3>
            Hazardous chemical waste is defined as any substance that poses a health risk to humans or that, if not
            properly managed, could harm the environment. Chemical waste can come from a variety of places, including
            chemical labs and industrial operations, as well as the disposal of domestic batteries and cleaning fluids.
            It can take many different physical forms, including solid, sludge, liquid, gas, or a combination of these.
            A chemical is considered hazardous if it is combustible at temperatures below 60°C (140°F); if it is
            corrosive and has a pH of less than 2 or greater than 12.5. If it is unstable, explosive, or reacts
            violently with water, or if it is toxic and could affect humans or the nearby ecosystem, it will be
            classified as hazardous.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-warning">Effects of Chemical Waste</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">
                According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health risks may result from direct contact with toxic
                materials that leach from Chemical-waste.Some of them includ:
            <ul>
                <li class="text-primary">
                    <u class="text-light">

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Eutrophication is the process through which a body of water, or parts of it, becomes increasingly
                    mineralized and nutrient-rich. It's also known as "nutrient-induced phytoplankton productivity
                    increase." Oligotrophic water bodies have very low nutrient levels, while mesotrophic water bodies
                    have moderate nutrient levels. Dystrophic and hypertrophic situations are terms used to describe
                    advanced eutrophication. Excess phosphorus is almost invariably the cause of eutrophication in
                    freshwater habitats.

                    When Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are discharged into the air, a chemical reaction occurs,
                    resulting in acid rain. These substances can ascend to great heights in the sky, where they mix and
                    react with water, oxygen, and other molecules to produce more acidic pollutants, which are known as
                    acid rain. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are very easy to dissolve in water and can be carried
                    a long distance by the wind. As a result, the two compounds are able to travel vast distances and
                    become part of the rain, sleet, snow, and fog that we encounter on some days.
                    When power plants burn fossil fuels like coal to generate electricity, they release the bulk of
                    Sulphur dioxide and a significant amount of nitrogen oxides. Furthermore, automobiles, trucks, and
                    buses emit nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere.
